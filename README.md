# Project README

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for efficiently fine-tuning and interpreting large language models (LLMs) using state-of-the-art quantization, fine-tuning techniques, and interpretability tools. Specifically, the project leverages 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for fine-tuning efficiency, and LLM Explainer for model interpretability.

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

```bash
pip install transformers bitsandbytes peft llm_explainer
```

### Running Notebooks

* Ensure each notebook is executed sequentially: first quantize, then fine-tune, and finally interpret the model.
* Adjust configuration parameters in each notebook according to your dataset and model specifics.
